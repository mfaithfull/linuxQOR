/*A workflow is a stack of states forming a state machine
The state at the topp of the stack is repeatedly Entered
until the stack is empty. States can pop themselves from
the stack or push other states onto it.
It's all a way of controlling the flow of a program
without having to write loops and function calls
explicitly. They are provided by the workflow automatically*/
