A folder of basic QOR examples.

All examples are platform independent, terminal/console, programs with no dependencies except QOR libraries.

outline:-
    The QOR's Hello World example. Not quite the simplest possible QOR app 
    but small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.

options:-
    Add traditional command line options to your application. 

roller:- 
    Real applications are built from Roles and Features.
    The QOR is designed for large scale applications built
    from these simple parts.

work:- 
    Add workflow state machines to manage the flow of your application.
    Workflows make expressing state management designs like statecharts easy.

plumbing:-
    Connect to files and the world with QOR Pipelines for IO and data processing.
    Learn how to transcode a file in one statement.

parallel:-
    Launch and use background services and custom parallel tasks. 
    Signals allow notification across threads enabling log
    aggregation
