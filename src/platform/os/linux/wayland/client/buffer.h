            Sent when this wl_buffer is no longer used by the compositor.
            The client is now free to reuse or destroy this buffer and its
            backing storage.

            If a client receives a release event before the frame callback
            requested in the same wl_surface.commit that attaches this
            wl_buffer to a surface, then the client is immediately free to
            reuse the buffer and its backing storage, and does not need a
            second buffer for the next surface content update. Typically
            this is possible, when the compositor maintains a copy of the
            wl_surface contents, e.g. as a GL texture. This is an important
            optimization for GL(ES) compositors with wl_shm clients.*/
