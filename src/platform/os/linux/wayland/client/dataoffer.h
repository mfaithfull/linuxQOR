             * to receiving wl_data_device.drop, the chosen action may change
             * (e.g. due to keyboard modifiers being pressed). At the time of
             * receiving wl_data_device.drop the drag-and-drop destination must
             * honor the last action received.
             *
             * Action changes may still happen after wl_data_device.drop,
             * especially on "ask" actions, where the drag-and-drop destination
             * may choose another action afterwards. Action changes happening
             * at this stage are always the result of inter-client negotiation,
             * the compositor shall no longer be able to induce a different
             * action.
             *
             * Upon "ask" actions, it is expected that the drag-and-drop
             * destination may potentially choose a different action and/or
             * mime type, based on wl_data_offer.source_actions and finally
             * chosen by the user (e.g. popping up a menu with the available
             * options). The final wl_data_offer.set_actions and
             * wl_data_offer.accept requests must happen before the call to
             * wl_data_offer.finish.
