This folder is the top level for components.

Components are QOR modules.
Components are optional for QOR projects, the main QOR classes don't depend on them. You can use them if you need them or ignore them if you don't.
Many components will be specializations of QOR classes such as Workflows or Allocators
Components can be dependent on any main QOR modules and on other components
Component folder should be arranged such that modules are under a hierarchy similar to where they would be if they were main QOR modules
