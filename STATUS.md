Just getting setup with the new linuxQOR repo and setting out the project.


Not really open to contributions at this stage because and only because there's no way for anyone else to comprehend the intent or what has/hasn't already been done.
However the QOR project is way too big for one person. As soon as the intent, style and overall direction is comprehensible to you, you're welcome to pitch in.

See my separate rant about why so much fundamental 'Open Source' isn't actually open, on request.
