The style of QOR code should now be clear, given the size of the codebase. The ubiquitous classes and 'utilities' of the QOR are all at least sketched out now.
If there's anything that fits the mould of code that exists to make other code easier to write then suggestions of extensions, specializations and improvements to the qor modules are welcome.

The direction of travel from here will be structural and control flow modules for the framework and some initial components for customizing memory management

Just getting setup with the new linuxQOR repo and setting out the project.


Not really open to contributions at this stage because and only because there's no way for anyone else to comprehend the intent or what has/hasn't already been done.
However the QOR project is way too big for one person. As soon as the intent, style and overall direction is comprehensible to you, you're welcome to pitch in.

See my separate rant about why so much fundamental 'Open Source' isn't actually open, on request.
