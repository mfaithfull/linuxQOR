#The overall layout of the project files will be described here

The intention of the QOR project is to follow the rule of 7. 
i.e. Only 7 folders in a folder. Only 7 files in a folder, 7 classes in a namespace, 7 namespaces in namespace. You get the idea.
This may not be strictly adhered to where there is no basis for subdivision
