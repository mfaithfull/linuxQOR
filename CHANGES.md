Will list breaking and or significant changes between releases once we reach a releasable milestone

Currently all is in flux towards the first potentially releasable milestone: A Linux and Windows C++ testing framework that combines yaffut, hippomocks and assertcc, maybe.

Things have gone apocalyptically well and I've gone some much beyond just the testing, asserting and mocking framework. The QOR is in danger of becoming actually useful and hence a first release is delayed until it is.
