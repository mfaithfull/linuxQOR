Wow, the C++ compiler market has narrowed since this project began. We need a modernish C++ compiler and that means we'll be supporting Microsoft's cl, known as MSVC and g++ known as GNU C++. Clang from Apple & Google effectively emulates the front ends of both while using an LLVM backend so It'll be best efforst to support that as well.

msvc
gcc
clang
