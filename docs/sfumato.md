The technique is typically applied in oil painting, where artists layer thin washes of colour to achieve the desired effect.

It was famously employed by Leonardo da Vinci, who described it as blending colours without lines or borders, resembling the effect of smoke.

By the use of many thin layers we remove the barriers to the eye and the understanding.
